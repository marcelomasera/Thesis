In order to access foreign markets, global investors often need to post collateral in
currencies that are different from their benchmark currency, resulting in undesired
foreign exchange risk. Investors might therefore be tempted to strictly post the
minimum margins required, however doing so maximizes the probability of margin
calls and their associated operational risk and cost. This article finds the posted margins
that represent the best equilibrium between foreign exchange risk and probability
of a margin call. In order to do so, a robust dynamic model of the asset prices and exchange
rates dynamics is proposed, and an optimization problem seeking the optimal equilibrium is
solved. The proposed model overperformed both a naive and a Gaussian alternative
model on a dataset of five futures contracts in four different currencies over a 
period of six years for the metrics of interest.
